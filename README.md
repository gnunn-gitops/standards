## Introduction

A work in progress on documenting some standards for GitOps and Kubernetes that I am using. Despite the repo being called "standards" This is not meant to be an authoritative document, I firmly believe that different organizations will need to define their own standards based on their organization structure, processes, etc.

This document is reflective of my personal preferences and the standards I use in my various gitops repos. I reserve the right to make changes as I continue my journey :)

## Documents

* [Tools](tools.md) - Thoughts on various manifest and gitops tools

* [Folders](folders.md) - Folder structure
